# Logic for High on drugs skulls game.
This is only the logic which be applied to [Vue2-Babel-Phaser-Es6-starter](https://github.com/sfra/Vue2-Babel-Phaser-Es6-starter). So far it can be treated as starter for typescript, jest, jsdoc internded for the usage with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (e.g. debugging support).

## Running example in 

### Setup
```bashjs
npm install
```
### Build
```bash
npm run build
```
### Run (nothing interesting, so far)
```bash
npm run start
```
